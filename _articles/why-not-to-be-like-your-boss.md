Admit it right away! You want to be like your boss, isn't it?

But you are curious about the title as well. That's not a bad thing at all. You will know shortly.

Way back during my registrar days, I had a fellow registrar who was working hard in the neurosurgery division. We were chatting up during the lunch hour. He had been working with the top neurosugeon of the day at the hospital. What would be your reaction if you got to work with the best in the field? Ecstatic, isn't it? I expected that out of my friend. But, yet he poured over how tough his boss was when it came to compensating him for his duties. He was contemplating on starting his own practice. Anyone in his position would probably be a little dreamy about it. Looking back, I certainly was when I started out. So I stopped him in his tracks, and told him --- *You can never be like your boss!*

He was completely taken aback by my words. He glared back at me, and took off from there. For a long time thereafter, he kept his distance. Fortunately there was another friend close by, who was watching as it was happening.

Inquisitive as ever, he questioned my logic --- *Why do you think he can't be like his boss? Do you think he's not good?*

Nope! That's not what I meant that day and that's not what I mean today as well.

Don't get me wrong here. You could emulate your boss. You can copy his mannerisms and his style, which is what most people often do. Most of us unknowingly, even if we don't admit it openly, end up doing what our respective bosses did[^cryptomnesia]. In the medical field, there's a strong emphasis on stewardship. The fact that we follow what they did is a dead give away as to where our admiration lies. You don't even have to admit it. Its obvious from your mannerisms and style.

*Where's the problem then? Are you saying stewardship is wrong?*

The problem starts, like it did for my friend, when you think you can be another Dr Rao[^DrRao].

You can *never* be like another person. Trying to be an exact copy of your boss is setting up yourself for failure. You cannot duplicate anyone for that matter. You are very different from your boss, or from anyone else in this universe. You have a unique way of talking, a way of communicating and a way of responding to your patients. That is what your patients see when they consult you. If you impose upon them the style of your boss, its going to look pretentious. Totally jarring to your unique personality. Each one of us, including you has a uniqueness. It is that which you need to identify, project and promote.

*Where does that leave our boss? He worked out great with patients. Wouldn't my patients benefit if I copied him?*

Remember, you can only be a better version of yourself. So the goal is to get better. Not to be another carbon copy of your boss. You have admired your boss for certain reasons. So identify the principles that define his practice. Apply those principles to your own practice. And then measure the results. If indeed, they produce desirable results[^vouch], be my guest. Apply those principles and make your patients happy. And if the results are not as you expected, you know what to do.

In effect, I am asking you to admit that your boss may not be the perfect example given the circumstances you are in. Your boss may be the perfect example of a life to lead, or a practice to follow given the circumstances he's in. Since the environments in which you are going to be practising is so variable, emulating is a better option than blind copying.

*That's all??*

It gets better from this point if you are still with me. It you are going to pick the best principles from this special boss of yours, then what stops you from picking up the best from the so many other *bosses* in your life. That unique combination of your best self, and the best principles from all the great personalities that crossed your life is what you need to be, my friend. That's the real you. That's what will appeal to your patients. That's what you should strive to achieve. For when you do that, you will find your boss start to suffer from cryptomnesia.

[^DrRao]: This is not the real name. I had my Dr Rao. I am sure you had one as well.
[^vouch]: I do not know your boss personally. So there is no way I can vouch that his principles will not produce undesirable results! Follow them at your own risk.
[^cryptomnesia]: There is a word in psychology for this --- [cryptomnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia). It is a memory bias whereby a person recalls a forgotten memory as something new and original (experiences it that way), when actually the person has been exposed to it in the past. Its not deliberate [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism), though it may appear so to others.
