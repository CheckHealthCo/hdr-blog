As a doctor you are not just providing service to a patient.

A relationship is built and secured over time. And the single factor that determines the fate of this tenuous relationship is --- *trust*.

Trust triumphs over everything else.

Trust is essential to cement this relationship. The patient's trust mechanism influences the outcome of everything that the doctor attempts.

Trust is often confused with confidence. Confidence follows trust. Confidence can appear enforced when the doctor controls the patient. This is something that still happens in many parts of the world. But, yet patients are starting to bridge the information asymmetry.[^InfoAsymmetry] As a result, confidence can come only via trust and rarely through control. Trust on the part of the patient is no longer blind and implied.[^EurPub2006-1] Most attempt confidence building measures. But the sad truth is that this will not work unless the you've secured the patient's trust.

*But why is trust so critical?*

Trust ensures a degree of security. It guarantees that things will turn out alright even in the face of uncertainty.[^DavidShore] Unpredictability is a norm in healthcare. Trust anchors the patient to the doctor. It sets the foundation for a stable relationship. Imagine the situation from the patient's view point. The patient has to discuss several personal issues. She has to submit herself to a physical examination. Such intimacy is rare in any other profession. Is intimacy possible without trust? The leap of faith required in such cases can only come from trust.

Trust is neither permanent nor always established. It is fragile and almost always, in constant need of care and nurturing. Unless you make an emotional connect, its difficult to maintain this trust-based relationship.

Patients also look for credibility and reliability in their doctors.[^MichaelGreen1] You sound credible when what you say matches what you do. And when you are consistent on that over several visits, then they consider you reliable. This varies based on the rational decision making ability of the visiting patient.

But the critical aspect that doctors, most often trip up on is avoiding self-interest. Your own self-interest should never be the motivation behind your actions. If the patient perceives so, expect your credibility to take a beating. Even if it is self-absorption and not selfishness, the patient is unlikely to return to  you.[^MichaelGreen2]

As a doctor, you must make all efforts to be credible. You have to deliver value to the patient in a consistent fashion (reliable). Strive to make an emotional connect with the patient's condition. And at all costs put the patient's interest above your own.[^MichaelGreen3]

Is it enough to just *appear* credible, reliable and focused on the patient's interest? Will pretending work?

Appearances may impact a single consultation, maybe be two or three. But remember, patients repeat visits and communicate within their circles. It is as much an uncertain world for them as it is for the doctors. They derive comfort from other patients. And its likely that they will see through your facile appearances. Its much better to practice being credible. And promote the patient's interest above your own. Its the only path to be the reliable doctor. Start as a ritual and soon it will become life-changing habit. Nothing is more convincing than when your actions are a natural extension of yourself.

Technical competence in itself is not enough to secure trust. Just being knowledgeable and having the ability to execute will not suffice. Communication skills trump over technical mastery in securing the patient's trust. Developing your soft skills is as important if not more important. Be aware --- *your medical skills are demonstrable only after you've secured the patient's confidence*. The patient will consent only after you've convinced her of your skills.

There are a couple of things you could do to gain the patient's confidence. The most important of them is --- *to listen*. Listening helps you empathize with the patient's vulnerable position. It also helps to keep your attention focused on the patient than yourself. Tailor your conversation to the patient's needs. Apply it in the context of a person who's seated in front of you. Make it less mechanical and more personal. That is what helps build inter-personal relationships. Be honest and direct but balance it with optimism. Be firm but make space for the patient's opinion and feelings.

What exactly is *word of mouth?*[^WOM]

Its nothing but evidence of the fact that you've gained the trust of the patient. Patient satisfaction will result in patients sharing and recommending you to others. But unless ratified by trust, word of mouth will not happen.

Working on developing trust takes time and effort. Results are not immediate. But investing time and energy into this will bring satisfying long term results in boosting your practice. Do not ignore this strategy.
