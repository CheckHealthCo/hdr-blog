In order to be successful, the one thing that the doctor has to focus on is *trust*.

Trust triumphs over everything else.

Trust is essential to cement the relationship between the patient and the doctor. The success of everything that a doctor does, depends decidedly on the patient's trust mechanism. Not to be confused with confidence. Confidence is expressed by the patient and follows trust. Confidence can also be conveyed when a patient is controlled by the doctor, something that still happens in many parts of the world. As patients increasingly bridge the information gap and start owning their condition, its likely that confidence can only come via trust and rarely through control. Trust on the part of the patient is no longer blind and implied [^EurPub2006]. Confidence building measures will not work unless you've gained the trust of the patient.

*But why is trust so critical?*

In the face of uncertainity, trust ensures a degree of security that things will turn out alright [^DavidShore]. Healthcare is unique in the degree of unpredictability that its practioners embrace. In such situations, trust anchors the patient to the doctor, and builds the foundation for a stable relationship.
